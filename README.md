# AltAlerter
This plugin keeps a history of player IPs and compares a joining player's current IP against all IPs used ever. If there's a match, sends an alert in console and to permitted players.

# Perms
Add "altAlerter.getAlerts" to your staff perms (without ") in order to receive alerts when a player joins with a different IP
